# CreditScoreEvaluator
A python programming language based project where the user needs to enter their credits at pass, defer and fail respectively. The total however should be exactly 120, and the marks entered by the user should be multiples of 20 between 0 and 120.
After the user quits the program, a histogram will be displayed along with the count of the marks entered.
